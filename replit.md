# ViajaJunto - Travel Companion Platform

## Overview

ViajaJunto is a web-based platform that connects travelers with common interests, destinations, and dates to share travel experiences and costs. Built as a full-stack application using modern web technologies, it enables users to create travel plans, find compatible travel companions, and coordinate shared expenses like accommodation, transportation, and activities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based auth
- **Session Storage**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Password Security**: Node.js crypto module with scrypt hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication, profile information, and travel preferences
- **Trips**: Travel plans with destinations, dates, budgets, and shared costs
- **Trip Participants**: Many-to-many relationship between users and trips
- **Messages**: Real-time chat functionality for trip groups
- **Trip Requests**: Request system for joining trips

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Local authentication with username/password
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Password hashing using Node.js scrypt with salt
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend
- User profile management with travel preferences

### Trip Management
- Trip creation with detailed planning (destination, dates, budget, style)
- Trip discovery with advanced filtering capabilities
- Participant management with request/approval system
- Real-time messaging within trip groups
- Shared cost tracking for various expense categories
- Expense splitting system similar to Splitwise
  - Add expenses with description, amount, and category
  - Split costs among selected participants
  - Automatic balance calculation
  - Settlement suggestions
  - Receipt upload support

### User Interface
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Component-based architecture using Radix UI primitives
- Dark/light theme support through CSS variables
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Loading states and error handling throughout the application

### Real-time Features
- Chat system with message polling (3-second intervals)
- Live trip participant updates
- Request notifications and status updates

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Users authenticate through the local strategy, sessions are stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Trip Creation**: Authenticated users create trips with detailed planning information
3. **Trip Discovery**: Users search and filter trips based on preferences and compatibility
4. **Join Requests**: Users request to join trips, creators approve/reject requests
5. **Communication**: Approved participants can chat within trip groups
6. **Cost Sharing**: Trip creators define shared expenses, participants coordinate payments

- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type safety

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact with static file serving

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Session secret for authentication security
- Neon PostgreSQL as the production database

### Development Setup
- `npm run dev`: Starts development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Creates production build
- `npm run start`: Runs production server
- `npm run db:push`: Syncs database schema with Drizzle

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface language: Portuguese (all UI elements translated from English to Portuguese).
